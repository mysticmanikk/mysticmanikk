Here are some of the projects that I contributed to significantly:

#CIS434 SE Projects:

-[Pizza Builder Application]: Link- https://github.com/MJamal12/CIS434FinalProject
Description: I worked as a Database manager and a little bit on the front-end to code the Pizza ordering user interface using the JavaFX and Gluon UI toolkit. I used the MySQL workbench to store the suer information and their password. I am yet to work on protecting their passwords using the hashing algorithm. This interface allows a person to login into the system and make desired choices on the menu and sums up the total at the checkout alongwith their delivery address.

-[Jenkins Integration in testing the code]: Link- https://github.com/MaksymYarosh/Group1_CIS434_GitAssignment
Description: We just build some test cases and I contributed significantly in building the pipeline to run the test cases for the java program in Jenkins.

#WorkInProgess Projects:

-Machine Learning Model
Description: Build and train a machine learning model for tasks like classification, regression, or clustering.
Concepts: Machine Learning Libraries(TensorFlow), data processing, and model evaluation.

-Expense Tracker
Description: Building an application to track and categorize personal expenses, generate reports, and visualize spending patterns.
Concepts: Data Visulaization, file handling, and user authentication.

-Big Data Handling
Description: A pipeline to process and analyze the data in real-time from various sources such as social media, sensors, or logs.
Concepts: Data ingestion through Apache Kafka, Data processing with Apache Storm, Data Storage in HDFS, and data visualisation with Tableau.

#Personal Project:

-Interpreter converting the python program to C program.
Description: Converting Python code into tokens through lexer and straming the tokens into an AST with parser that will be based on Python's grammar. Transforming AST into intermediate representation or directly into C code.Optimizing the genrated C code for performance and efficiency.
Concepts: Design Basis(Python lists-> C Arrays; Python Classes -> C Structs); Parser built using recursive descent parsing; Lexer is implemented using the regular expressions
