Here are some of th eprojects that I contributed to significantly:

#CIS434 SE Projects:

-[Pizza Builder Application]: Link- https://github.com/MJamal12/CIS434FinalProject
Description: I worked as a Database manager and a little bit on the front-end to code the Pizza ordering user interface using the JavaFX and Gluon UI toolkit. I used the MySQL workbench to store the suer information and their password. I am yet to work on protecting their passwords using the hashing algorithm. This interface allows a person to login into the system and make desired choices on the menu and sums up the total at the checkout alongwith their delivery address.

-[Jenkins Integration in testing the code]: Link- https://github.com/MaksymYarosh/Group1_CIS434_GitAssignment
Description: We just build some test cases and I contributed significantly in building the pipeline to run the test cases for the java program in Jenkins.
